# YouTube Clone (But Like... Really Basic)

Welcome to my very first project! This is my attempt at recreating the iconic YouTube homepage with just HTML and CSS. Yes, that's right—no JavaScript, no backend, just pure determination and a lot of CSS frustration. If you've ever wondered what YouTube would look like if it were made by someone learning to code, you’re in the right place!

## Project Link

Check it out live [here](https://silenttrader99.github.io/youtube/) — it’s almost like the real thing, minus the functionality, ads, and, well... videos.

## Features (Or My Best Attempt At Them)

- **Static Layout**: All the videos stay exactly where they are. Not a single one plays, but hey, they look like they *might*.
- **Fake View Counts and Upload Dates**: Impress your friends with 18M views on a math video! These numbers are as real as the video player here.
- **Responsive-ish Design**: Shrinks and stretches on some screen sizes, like it’s trying its best to fit in.
- **Thumbnail Parade**: Thumbnails galore! Each one frozen in time with that tantalizing “play” button… that does nothing.

## Technologies I Struggled With

- **HTML**: To stack things vaguely in the right order.
- **CSS**: To move things around on the page until they look okayish. Aligning? Centering? Oh, the horror!

## Acknowledgements
Big shoutout to YouTube for the inspiration, and apologies for the rough imitation. None of the content is real, and no animals were harmed in the making of this project—though some brain cells might have been.

Hope you enjoy my “YouTube Clone”! Maybe someday it’ll actually play a video. Until then, enjoy the stillness.
